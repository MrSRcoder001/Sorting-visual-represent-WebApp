🔢 Sorting Algorithm Visualization Website
📌 Overview

The Sorting Algorithm Visualization Website is an interactive web application designed to visually demonstrate how different sorting algorithms work step by step.
It helps students and beginners understand sorting logic through real-time animations and comparisons.

This project is built using pure frontend technologies without any frameworks, focusing on core JavaScript logic and DOM manipulation.

🎯 Features

📊 Visual representation of array elements using bars

🔄 Step-by-step animation of sorting algorithms

⏱ Adjustable sorting speed

📈 Dynamic array size generation

🔁 Reset and regenerate array functionality

🎨 Clean and responsive UI using Bootstrap

🧠 Implemented Sorting Algorithms

Bubble Sort

Selection Sort

Insertion Sort

Merge Sort

Quick Sort

Each algorithm visually shows:

Comparisons

Swaps

Final sorted output

🛠️ Tech Stack

HTML5 – Structure of the application

CSS3 – Styling and animations

JavaScript (ES6) – Sorting logic and visualization

Bootstrap – Responsive UI design

⚙️ How It Works

The application generates a random array of numbers.

Each array element is displayed as a vertical bar.

When a sorting algorithm is selected, the bars animate to show comparisons and swaps.

Colors indicate different operations such as comparison, swap, and sorted state.

The process continues until the array is fully sorted.
